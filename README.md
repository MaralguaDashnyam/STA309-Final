## Overview

This repository contains the final project for STA309, focusing on diabetes prediction using statistical and machine learning models. The goal is to analyze the relationships between patient attributes (e.g., BMI, glucose, HbA1c levels) and diabetes status, while comparing the performance of logistic regression, decision trees, and random forest models.

The project includes:  
1. **An `.Rmd` file** with detailed code and commentary for every step of the analysis.  
2. **This README** summarizing the project results and key insights, alongside visualizations.  
3. **Plots and screenshots** to demonstrate key findings and the interactive dashboard.

For a full explanation of the methodology and detailed implementation, refer to the [`STA309-Final-Hera-Dashnyam.Rmd`](STA309-Final-Hera-Dashnyam.Rmd) file.

## Part 4: Visualization

### BMI Distribution
The histogram below visualizes the distribution of BMI in the dataset. It highlights clusters and provides insights into patient demographics.

### HbA1c vs. Blood Glucose Level Scatter Plot
The scatter plot reveals a strong positive relationship between HbA1c_level and blood_glucose_level. Diabetic patients (in blue) generally have higher levels of both, making these variables critical in diabetes prediction.

## Part 5: Dashboard

### Diabetes Prediction Dashboard
An interactive dashboard was built to summarize key insights, allowing users to explore relationships between variables like age, BMI, and glucose. The dashboard includes visualizations, model predictions, and adjustable inputs for real-time analysis.

## Additional Details

- For the complete step-by-step code and detailed explanations, refer to the [`STA309-Final-Hera-Dashnyam.Rmd`](STA309-Final-Hera-Dashnyam.Rmd) file.
- The `.Rmd` file is structured to allow replication of results, from data cleaning to final visualizations and model comparisons.
